VIDEO OVER INTRANET SYSTEM

Video calling or voice calling through the use of the internet is a very common thing in today's world. Nevertheless, users have to pay charges directly or indirectly, tolerating all the delays even if you use the facility within the same network or sub-network.There are several drawbacks of using video calling over the internet within a small network such as delay of packets (travel to the main server outside network and reenter the same network again), direct or indirect costs, users need to be always connected online and efficiency and speed of the user's system vary according to connection quality and bandwidth. In this project, we implemented a WebRTC enabled web application which provides free peer to peer video calling and conferencing tool . On a big campus of over 90 acres, communication was impossible when internet connections were interrupted or social media sites were down. Communication over the intranet was the only solution that was feasible, affordable, and scalable over the bandwidth of the college's network. To satisfy the above needs, we adapted the efforts of WebRTC project.
